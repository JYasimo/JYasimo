# Hi there 👋, I'm Yasi!

I graduated from the University of Tehran in 2021 with a degree in Material Engineering 🎓. 

In 2023, I moved to Australia 🇦🇺 to pursue my Master of Data Science and Innovation at the University of Technology Sydney 📊. 

My engineering background gives me a unique perspective as a data scientist, allowing me to approach problems analytically and find practical solutions 🛠️.


I'm passionate about driving innovation and using data to make a positive impact. Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate to shape a data-driven future!
